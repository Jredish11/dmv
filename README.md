# The DMV

This is the starter repo for the BE Mod1 DMV project.

Reflection/Debugging:

1. I ran rspec on the entire dmv directory and looked for the errors and through the stack trace to see where they were occuring.  Then I opened each spec file and their corresponding class file side by side.  X'ing each test in the spec file's and running rspec for the specific spec file. See the errors and go into the application code and make the necessary changes. After each debug I would do a git add, git commit.  

2. It can be hard to see the small little errors, like spelling.  The error message for the facilities_offering_service method was confusing to read at first glance and could trip you up when trying to "find" a solution.  Also I find the objects for each class and the different attributes can be hard to remember or visualize without typing it out yourself. Like some parameters holding string values and some would be a hash(one element) that holds data inside.  

3. Having done this assignment once it was definitely easier this go around. And that isn't due to the fact that I've seen this before, but that I truly have gotten better at debugging.  I feel like this took over an hour to get through the first time, this time took less than 20 minutes.
